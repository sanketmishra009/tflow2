# `transformer.ipynb`

This notebook provides an **introduction** to using **Transformer-based** architectures in TensorFlow 2. It demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a Transformer model for a chosen task (such as text classification, language modeling, or sequence-to-sequence translation). The notebook is designed to help readers understand the fundamental components and workflow when working with Transformers in a TensorFlow/Keras environment.

## Overview

Transformers have become a powerful architecture for handling sequential data, especially in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** tasks. They use a **self-attention** mechanism to capture long-range dependencies without the need for recurrence. 

In this notebook, you will learn:

- How to **prepare and tokenize** text data for Transformer models.  
- How to **build** a Transformer architecture from scratch (encoder/decoder blocks, attention mechanisms, positional encodings).  
- How to **train** the model and **monitor** performance metrics.  
- How to **evaluate** the modelâ€™s performance on unseen data.

## Dependencies

Before running the notebook, ensure your environment includes the following libraries (versions compatible with TensorFlow 2.x):

- **Python** 3.7+  
- **TensorFlow** 2.x  
- **numpy**  
- **pandas** (optional, if the dataset is in CSV or similar format)  
- **matplotlib** or **seaborn** (for plotting training curves)  
- **tqdm** (optional, for progress bars)  
- **sentencepiece** / **subword-nmt** (optional, if using advanced tokenization)  

To install or update these dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
