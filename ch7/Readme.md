# TensorFlow 2: Chapter 7 - Advanced Deep Learning Concepts

This repository contains the code and resources for Chapter 7 of my TensorFlow 2 series, focusing on advanced deep learning concepts. This chapter delves into topics such as custom training loops, advanced regularization techniques, optimization strategies, and transfer learning using pre-trained models.

## Features

- Implementation of custom training loops.
- Advanced regularization techniques such as dropout, batch normalization, and L1/L2 regularization.
- Optimization strategies including learning rate schedules and momentum.
- Examples of complex model architectures.
- Transfer learning with pre-trained models, including Inception.

## Transfer Learning

This repository explores the use of transfer learning to leverage pre-trained models for improved performance on specific tasks. Transfer learning is particularly useful when working with limited datasets, as it allows the model to utilize features learned from large, diverse datasets.

### Inception Model

The Inception model, also known as GoogleNet, is a deep convolutional neural network architecture that achieves high performance by using a unique combination of inception modules. These modules employ filters of varying sizes to capture spatial hierarchies and extract features at different scales, making the model both efficient and effective.

In this project, the Inception model is used as a feature extractor. The steps include:

1. Loading the pre-trained Inception model with weights trained on ImageNet.
2. Freezing the convolutional base to retain learned features.
3. Adding custom layers on top of the base to adapt the model to the specific task.
4. Fine-tuning the model (optional) by unfreezing a few top layers and training them on the new dataset.

The use of Inception significantly accelerates training time and enhances model accuracy by leveraging its robust feature extraction capabilities.
